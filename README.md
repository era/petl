# PETL (Personal ETL)

Today most of our data is hostage by Big Tech, although most services do offer ways to pull all your personal data, it normally takes several manual steps to do it. This project tries to automate the process of pulling all personal data into our own databases.

You probably want to fork this and adapt to your own need. If you do and need help, let me know.

## Goals

- Pull the data I'm insterested in keeping
- Save the data in a local database (no Cloud)
